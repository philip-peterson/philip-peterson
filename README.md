### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil. It's nice to meet you!

Iâ€™m currently working at Copia Automation to help create a [version control system](https://www.copia.io/) for industrial automation use cases. This is working on the stuff running roller coasters, manufacturing plants, and more. If you are looking for an adventurous startup to join working closely with Git, check us out!

Happy to chat on Twitter as well: [@ironmagma](https://twitter.com/ironmagma).
